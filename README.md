# CapstoneProject
In this project , our goal is to classify customer add-to-cart behavior (0 = browsing only, 1 = added once, 2 = added multiple times) based on their browsing activity 
and survey responses by using K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.
The dataset dataset collected for analyzing the behavioral analysis of Amazon's consumers consists of a comprehensive 
collection of customer interactions,browsing patterns within the Amazon ecosystem. It includes a wide range of
variables such as customer demographics, user interaction, and reviews. The dataset
aims to provide insights into customer preferences, shopping habits, and decision-making processes on 
the Amazon platform. By analyzing this dataset, researchers and analysts can gain a deeper understanding
of consumer behavior, identify trends, optimize marketing strategies, and improve the overall customer experience on Amazon.

## Understanding the Data
This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
