# Capstone Project
This project aims to classify Amazon customers based on their add-to-cart behavior, specifically whether they add products while browsing (Yes), do not add any (No), or are uncertain (Maybe), using their browsing activity and survey responses. To achieve this, we apply machine learning models, including
 - Logistic Regression
 - K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
 - Decision Trees
 - Support Vector Machines(SVM)
 - XGBoost
 - GaussianNB
 - Random Forest.

The dataset is designed to provide insights into customer preferences, shopping habits, and decision-making processes. By analyzing it, researchers and analysts can gain a deeper understanding of consumer behavior, identify emerging trends, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance the overall customer experience on Amazon.

## Understanding the Data
This dataset originates from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swathiunnikrishnan/amazon-consumer-behaviour-dataset) and was collected through a survey on the Amazon ecosystem.
 - **Size:** 603 observations with 23 features
 - **Label:**
    - "Yes": customer added item(s)
    - "No": customer browsing only
    - "Maybe": customer is uncertain
 - **Features:** "Timestamp","age","Gender","Purchase_Frequency","Purchase_Categories",
  "Personalized_Recommendation_Frequency","Browsing_Frequency", "Product_Search_Method",    "Search_Result_Exploration",Customer_Reviews_Importance', "Add_to_Cart_Browsing", "Cart_Completion_Frequency", "Cart_Abandonment_Factors","Saveforlater_Frequency", "Review_Left", "Review_Reliability",
    "Review_Helpfulness","Recommendation_Helpfulness","Rating_Accuracy","Shopping_Satisfaction "  "Service_Appreciation", "Improvement_Areas"
