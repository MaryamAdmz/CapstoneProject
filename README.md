# Capstone Project
This project aims to classify Amazon customers by their add-to-cart behavior (browsing only, adding once, adding multiple times) based on their browsing activity and survey responses using machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines(SVM), XGBoost, GaussianNB, and Random Forest.

The dataset collected for analyzing the behavioral analysis of Amazon's consumers consists of a comprehensive 
collection of customer interactions and browsing patterns within the Amazon ecosystem. It includes a wide range of
variables such as customer demographics, user interaction, and reviews. The dataset
aims to provide insights into customer preferences, shopping habits, and decision-making processes on 
the Amazon platform. By analyzing this dataset, researchers and analysts can gain a deeper understanding
of consumer behavior, identify trends, optimize marketing strategies, and improve the overall customer experience on Amazon.

## Understanding the Data
