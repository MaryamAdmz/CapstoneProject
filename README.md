# Capstone Project
This project aims to classify Amazon customers based on their add-to-cart behavior, specifically whether they add products while browsing (Yes), do not add any (No), or are uncertain (Maybe), using their browsing activity and survey responses. To achieve this, we apply machine learning models, including
 - Logistic Regression
 - K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
 - Decision Trees
 - Support Vector Machines(SVM)
 - XGBoost
 - GaussianNB
 - Random Forest.

The dataset is designed to provide insights into customer preferences, shopping habits, and decision-making processes. By analyzing it, researchers and analysts can gain a deeper understanding of consumer behavior, identify emerging trends, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance the overall customer experience on Amazon.

## Understanding the Data

 - **Size:** 603 observations with 23 features
 - **Label:**
    - "Yes": customer added item(s)
    - "No": customer browsing only
    - "Maybe": customer is uncertain

### Detailed Insights
The dataset was examined for missing values, duplicates, and outliers: 
  - Only 2 null values were found in the Product_search_Method column; they were replaced with the mode of that column.
  - The dataset contains a duplicated column, Personalized_Recommendation_Frequency, once as an object type and once as int64.
  - No outliers were detected in the dataset.
    
Based on my analysis of the dataset, several interesting patterns emerged about how customers interact with Amazon. These insights individually focus on age, gender, product preferences, and browsing habits:
- Age Group Activity: Young users aged 0–20 are the most active on the platform. They interact with the website more than other age groups.
- Gender Breakdown: Most customers are female (58.5%), followed by male (23.6%), prefer not to say (14.8%), and others (3.16%).
- Popular Product Categories:
 The top three categories are: Clothing and Fashion, Beauty and Personal Care, and Others.
In comparison, categories like Groceries and Home and Kitchen are less popular.
- What Customers Like:
People appreciate: Product recommendations, Good prices, A wide selection of items
- What Needs Improvement:
Customers want better: Customer service, Product quality and accuracy, and Less packaging waste.
- Browsing Patterns: Female users tend to browse more during the evening and night.
### Combined Insight: Age, Gender, Time, and Purchase Behavior
When we look at age, gender, time, and add-to-cart behavior, Female adults and young adults are the main group who browse without buying, especially at night. The same group also tends to make purchases at night more than others.


## Understanding the Task
The goal of this machine learning project is to identify the key factors that influence whether a customer adds an item to their cart on Amazon. By understanding the patterns behind this behavior, we aim to improve product engagement and conversion strategies.

We seek to answer questions such as:
- Does age group affect the likelihood of adding items to the cart?
- How does time of day influence behavior?
- What role does gender play in purchase intention?
- Are there specific product categories that trigger more add-to-cart actions?
- Does browsing behavior (duration, frequency) predict add-to-cart intent?
 
By training models on these features, we aim to build a predictive tool that can help e-commerce platforms personalize product recommendations and improve customer conversion rates.
